This project allows employers to create and make available job offers that will be performed by service providers. The platform contains three main areas: Public (general access), Private (employers and service providers) and Administrative (platform administrators). The public area contains information about job offers, where you can search at least for descriptive, category, and / or time type. Its also possible to visualize the available job offers grouped by category, and a user have an authentication / registration section. For the user registration, you need to indicate (at least) your profile (employer or service provider), your name / company, address and contact (s). In the case of the service provider it is still necessary to indicate a photo for your profile.
